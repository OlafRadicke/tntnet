MVC demo application
====================

This demo application shows how to use a model view controller pattern in
tntnet.

The application has a counter, which can be incremented and decremented by the
user using 2 buttons.

The model can be found in the `model` sub directory. In our case it is a simple
all in line class `Counter`, which holds the current counter state. Typical
applications have more complex and many objects.

The model define the classes, which are needed to held the state of our
application.

The `view` sub directory defines the screens, which defines the interactions
with the user. In our case it shows the current counter value and a form with 2
buttons to increment or decrement the counter.

Note that the view contain only the body of our html page. The html frame can be
found in the top level directory in `main.ecpp`. The trick is here to create a
mapping, where instead of calling the view directly this main layout component
is called. The name of the component is passed as a argument named `next` to the
main component. After printing the html header it calls that component and after
returning it prints to bottom of the page. Here we can define the layout for all
pages including menus, css or javascript definitions.

The remaining sub directory is the `controller`. Here we define the actions,
which makes our application complete. The controller queries whether one of the
buttons was pressed and do whatever is needed.

The controller is again called using mapping. This is done before calling the
view, so that the controller gets the chance to do whatever manipulations are
needed in the model.
